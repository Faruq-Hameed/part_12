### Type parameters
Since we began using lists, we have given data structures the type of the values that we want them to store. For example, a list that stores strings has been defined as ArrayList<String>, and a hash map that stores keys and values as Strings has been defined as HashMap<String, String>. How on Earth can you implement a class that can contain objects of a given type?

Generics relates to how classes that store objects can store objects of a freely chosen type. The choice is based on the generic type parameter in the definition of the classes, which makes it possible to choose the type(s) at the moment of the object's creation. Using generics is done in the following manner: after the name of the class, follow it with a chosen number of type parameters. Each of them is placed between the 'smaller than' and 'greater than' signs, like this: public class Class<TypeParameter1, TypeParameter2, ...>. The type parameters are usually defined with a single character.
The definition public class Locker<T> indicates that the Locker class must be given a type parameter in its constructor. After the constructor call is executed, all the variables stored in that object are going to be of the type that was given with the constructor.
There is no maximum on the number of type parameters, it's all dependent on the implementation. The programmer could implement the following Pair class that is able to store two objects of specified types.
A significant portion of the Java data structures use type parameters, which enables them to handle different types of variables. ArrayList, for instance, receives a single type parameter, while HashMap receives two.
List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
Map<String, String> keyValuePairs = new HashMap<>();
From here on out when you see the type ArrayList<String>, you know that its internal implementation uses a generic type parameter. The same principle holds true for the interface Comparable, for example.

Creating generic interfaces is very similar to creating generic classes. Below you can study the generic interface List (our own definition, which is not as extensive as the existing Java List).
There are two ways for a class to implement a generic interface. One is to decide the type parameter in the definition of the class, and the other is to define the implementing class with a type parameter as well. Below, the class MovieList defines the type parameter when it implements List. The MovieList is meant only for handling movies.
The alternative is to use a type parameter in the class definition, in which case the parameter is passed along to the interface. Now this concrete implementation of the interface remains generic.
If you wanted, you could also use the existing ArrayList class to implement the GeneralList.

### ArrayList and hash table
ArrayList and HashMap are commonly used data structures in programming. We are now going to take a look at their actual implementation. First we'll remind ourselves of how to use an array, after which we're going to build a data structure called List, imitating ArrayList. Then we'll make use of the List to implement the data structure HashTable.

## A brief recap of arrays
- An array is an object that contains a limited number of places for values. The length (or size) of an array is the number of places in it; in other words, how many values can be stored in the array. The size of an array is always predetermined: it is chosen when the array is created, and cannot be changed later.

- The array type is defined with square brackets preceded by the type of the elements in the array (typeOfElements[]). An array is created with the new call, followed by the type of the elements in that array, square brackets, and the number of elements in the array places inside the square brackets.
- The elements of the array are referred to by the indexes.

- Setting a single value to a certain position is done similarly to setting a value to a regular variable, just that when placing the value in an array, you use the index to indicate the position.

- To discover the size of an array you can use the public object variable length that arrays have.
- Arrays can be used in the exact same manner as other variables, so they can be object variables, method parameters, return values of methods, and so on.

- A significant portion of generally used data structures use arrays in their internal implementation.

## List
Let's examine one way to implement the Java ArrayList data structure. Java ArrayList uses an array. The type of the elements in the array is defined by the type parameter given to the ArrayList. Due to this we can add nearly any type of data to a list. Java List offers multiple methods, but right now add, contains, remove and get are most relevant for us.

# Creating a new list
Let's create class List. The List has a generic array — the type of the elements in the array is defined on run time using type parameters. Let's set the size of the array to 10. The array is created as type object, and changed to type generic with (A[]) new Object[10]; — this is done because Java does not support the call new A[10]; for now.

List encapsulates an array. In the beginning, every element in the array contains a null-reference.

# Adding values to the list
The size of the list does not grow. One of the benefits of the ArrayListclass is, that it grows as needed — Programmers do not have to worry about the list getting full.
The size of the list does not grow. One of the benefits of the ArrayListclass is, that it grows as needed — Programmers do not have to worry about the list getting full.

Let's add the functionality for increasing the size of the List. The size of the List increases if the user tries to add a value to a full list. The size of the List is increased by creating a new, larger, array to which the values ​​from the old array are copied to. After this the old array is Abandoned and the List starts to use the new array.

The size of the array is determined in Java with the formula oldSize + oldSize / 2. Let's use the same formula in our implementation. We'll create a new method growfor increasing the size of the array. The method is available only for other methods in the class (it is private).
The implementation creates a new array whose size is 1.5 times the size of the old array. After this all the elements of the old array are copied into the new one, and finally the value of the object variable valuesis set to the new array. The automatic Java garbage Collector removes the old array at some point, now that there are no longer any References to it.
Now we can add almost Unlimited amount of elements to the List.

# On the effectiveness of this method
The method described above copies every element from the old array to the new array. If we would have for example two million elements in an array, we must go through two million elements while copying them.

We will discuss the effectiveness of this method — and ways to make it more effective — in the courses Datastructures and Algorithms and Design and analysis of algorithms.

# Checking the existence of a value
Next we'll create the method public boolean contains(Type value), which we use to check whether the List contains a value or not. We will make use of the fact that each Java object — no matter its type — inherits the Object class (or is type Object). Due to this, each object has the method public boolean equals(Object object), which we can use to check equality.

The variable firstFreeIndexcontains the number of elements in the array. We can implement the containsmethod so, that it only checks the Indexes in the array which contain a value.

public boolean contains(Type value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < this.firstFreeIndex; i++) {
        if (this.values[i].equals(value)) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
We can now inspect the elements in the List.

List<String> myList = new List<>();
System.out.println(myList.contains("hello"));
myList.add("hello");
System.out.println(myList.contains("hello"));
Sample output
false true

The method above assumes, that the user will not add a nullreference to the list, and that the equals method checks that the value given to it as a parameter is not null.

# Removing a value
We can now add values to the List, and check if the List contains a value. Now we will implement the functionality for removing a value from the List. Let's implement the method public void remove(Type value), which removes one value type value.
The above implementation is however problematic, because it leaves "empty" slots to the List, which would lead to the contains method not working.
We are not really satisfied with the solution above, because it does too many things at the same time. The method looks for an element and moves elements around. We will split the functionality into two methods: private int indexOfValue(Type value), which searches for the index of the value given to it as a parameter, and private void moveToTheLeft(int fromIndex), which moves the elements above the given index to the left.

First let's implement the method private int indexOfValue(Type value), which searches for the index of the given value. The method returns -1 if the value is not found.
Then we will implement the method private void moveToTheLeft(int fromIndex), which moves values from the given index one place to the left.

private void moveToTheLeft(int fromIndex) {
    for (int i = fromIndex; i < this.firstFreeIndex - 1; i++) {
        this.values[i] = this.values[i + 1];
    }
}

# On the effectiveness of the method
The method describes above copies each element after the removed element one place to the left. Think about the effectiveness of this method when the List is used as a queue.

We will discuss the effectiveness of this method — and ways to make it more effective — in the courses Data structures and algorithms and Design and analysis of algorithms.
The class List now contains some repeated code. The method contains is very similiar to the method indexOfValue. Let's modify the method contains so that it uses the method indexOfValue.

public boolean contains(Type value) {
    return indexOfValue(value) >= 0;
}
Now we have a List, which has the methods add, contains, and remove. The List also grows in size when needed. The implementation of the List could of course be improved by for example adding functionality for decreasing the size of the List if the number of values in it decreases.

# Size of the List
Lastly we will add a method for checking the size of the List. The size of the list can be determined by the variable firstFreeIndex.

### Hash map
Hash map is implemented as an array, in which every element includes a list. The lists contain (key, value) pairs. The user can search from the hash map based on the key, and they can also add new key-value pairs into it. Each key can appear at most once in the hash map.

The functioning of the hash map is based on the hash value of the key. When a new (key, value) pair is stored in a hash map, we calculate a hash value based on the key to be stored. The hash value decides the index of the internal array that will be used for storing. The (key, value) pair is stored in the list that can be found at that index.

## Key-value pair
The Pair class contains a key and a value, as well as the related get methods. The generic types K and V are named so after the words 'key' and 'value'.
Creating key-value pairs is straightforward.
Pair<String, Integer> pair = new Pair<>("one", 1);

## Creating a hash map
A hash map contains an array of lists. Each value on the list is a pair (described in the previous section) that contains a key and a value. A hash map also knows the number of the values. Here we have at our disposal the previously created class List.

# Retrieving a value
Let's implement a method called public V get(K key). It can be used to search for a value based on a key.

# Why not implement hash map as a list?
The main principle of the hash map is that the key-value pairs are divided into small sets with the help of hash values. In this case a search based on key demands only going through a very small number of key-value pairs — assuming that the hash values are calculated in a sensible manner.

If the hash value is always the same — e.g. 1 — the internal implementation of a hash map is similar to a list — all the values are on the same list. If the hash values are sufficiently random, the different values are as evenly distributed to the different lists as possible.

Hash maps also grow the size of their internal array if the number of values becomes large enough (typically 75% of the size of the array). Typically a hash map that contains millions of key-value pairs only contains a few key-value pairs in each index. The practical consequence is that discovering if a key-value pair exists, we only need to calculate the hash value and examine a few objects — this is very significantly faster than going through a single list that contains the entirety of stored values.

# Adding to hash map
Let's implement the first version of the method public void add(K key, V value), which is used to add values to the hash map. In this version we are not going to increase the size of the internal array when new values are added to the hash map.

The method first calculates the hash value for the key, and uses it to determine the suitable index in the internal array. If there is no value in that index, we create a list into that index. After this the method goes through the list at the index, and looks for a key-value pair whose key matches the key of the key-value pair to be added. If the matching key is found, the value related to it is updated to match the new value. Otherwise the method adds a new key-value pair in the list — in which case the number of stored values is also incremented by one.

# Adding to hash table, part 2
The way of adding to a hash table that was described above works partly. The greatest fault in the functionality is that the size of the internal array is not increased when the number of values grows too large. Let's add a growing functionality to the program that doubles the size of the internal array of the hash map. The growing operation should also place each value in the hash map into the newly created bigger array.

Let's sketch the beginning of the growing functionality. The responsible method should create a new array whose size is double that of the old array. After this it goes through the old array, index by index. The encountered key-value pairs are copied into the new array. Finally, the old array is replaced with the new one.
private void grow() {
    // crete a new array
    List<Pair<K, V>>[] newValues = new List[this.values.length * 2];

    for (int i = 0; i < this.values.length; i++) {
        // copy the values of the old array into the new one

    }

    // replace the old array with the new one
    this.values = newValues;
}

# Remove
The removal functionality returns null if the value cannot be found, and otherwise it will remove the value that is paired with the key to be removed.

We can take advantage of the method we've already implemented in the removing method. Explain to yourself (out loud) how the method described below concretely works.

# On search performance
Let's compare the performance of searching from a list or a hash map. To evaluate performance we can use the System.nanotime() method and the value it returns, which represents the time as nanoseconds. The program first creates a hash map and a list, each containing a million elements, after which a thousand randomly chosen values are chosen from both. Roughly 50 % of the values are found with both structures.
The list and hash map that are described in this chapter do have some differences from the readymade tools we use elsewhere in the course. The data structures offered by the programming language have more different kinds of optimizations — other courses go more in detail with these specifics. For the purposes of this course it's enough to know how to use the data structures and to have some idea of the performance differences and when they are suitable to use.

# Randomness
Encryption algorithms, machine learning and making computer games less predictable all require randomness. We can model randomness using random numbers. Java offers ready-made Random class for creating random numbers. 
Above we create an instance of the Randomclass. It has nextInt method, which gets an integer as a parameter. The method returns a random number between [0, integer[ or 0..(integer -1).
We can use the nextInt method to create diverse randomness. For example, we might need a program to give us a temperature between [-30,50]. We can do this by first creating random a number between 0 and 80 and then subtracting 30 from it.

Random weatherMan = new Random();
int temperature = weatherMan.nextInt(81) - 30;
System.out.println(temperature);

A Random object can also be used to create random doubles. These can for example be used for calculating probabilities. Computers often simulate probabilities using doubles between [0..1].

The nextDouble method of the Random class creates random doubles. Let's assume the weather follows these probabilities:

There is 0.1 probability it rains (10%)
There is 0.3 probability it snows (30%)
There is 0.6 probability the sun shines (60%)

The makeAForecast method is interesting in many ways. The this.random.nextGaussian() call is a regular method call. However what is interesting is that this method of the Random class returns a normally distributed number (normally distributed numbers can be used to for example model the heights and weights of people — if you are not interested in different kinds of randomness that is OK!).
In the previous example we use explicit type casting to convert doubles to integers (int). We can equally convert integers to doubles with (double) integer.

## On randomness of numbers
We can predict how computers work, because they slavishly execute any command we give them. Is a random number generated by a computer then really random?

Random numbers used by computer programs are typically pseudorandom. They seem like random numbers, but in reality they follow some algorihmically created series of numbers. Most of the time pseudorandom is good enough — for example the user will not notice any difference when YouTube random play is pseudorandom. On the other hand if random numbers are used for scientific calculations, using a weak pseudorandom number generator can lead to questionable results. One example is IBM's RANDU which was used for a short while in the 1960's.
All randomness in computer programs is not pseudorandom. Programs aiming for stronger randomness use, among other things, real life random phenomena to generate random numbers. For example space radiation or lava lamps are thought to be random phenomena.

### Multidimensional data
In Java, multidimensional data is represented using multidimensional arrays, which are essentially arrays of arrays. They allow you to store data in a table-like structure (rows and columns) or even higher dimensions like 3D arrays.
- A multidimensional array is an array that contains other arrays as its elements.
- The most common type is the two-dimensional (2D) array, which resembles a matrix or table.
- You can also create 3D arrays or more, though they are less commonly used.
Previously we have used one dimensional arrays, where the index tells us the location of a value in the only dimension. We can also create multidimensional arrays. Then we need the indexes of a value in each dimension to access the value. This comes handy when our data is multidimensional, for example when dealing with coordinates.
A two dimensional array with two rows and three columns can be created like so
We can iterate over a two dimensional array using two nested for loops.
- Arrays.deepToString(array) → works for multidimensional arrays. It recursively prints all elements, e.g. [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].
We can see that the default value of variables type int is 0.

## Array vs. Hash table
